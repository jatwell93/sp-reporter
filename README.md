## Requirements

- Super Productivity version 14.0.0 or higher
- Modern web browser with clipboard API support

## Development

### Testing

The plugin includes unit tests using Vitest. The tests use JSDOM to load the actual `date-range-reporter/index.html` file with a mocked PluginAPI, ensuring the production code is tested directly.

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Or using make
make test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

#### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- Date utility functions (formatting, display, range generation)
- Report generation and validation
- Plugin integration with mocked PluginAPI
- Theme detection
- UI helper functions

### Building the Plugin

```bash
# Build the plugin zip file
make build

# Clean up generated files
make clean

# Show all available commands
make help
```

### Creating a Release

To create a new release:

1. **Update the version** in `date-range-reporter/manifest.json`
2. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v1.x.x"
   git push
   ```
3. **Run the release command**:
   ```bash
   make release
   ```

The `make release` command will automatically:
- ✅ Verify prerequisites (GitHub CLI installed, clean working directory)
- 📦 Build the plugin zip file
- 🏷️ Create a git tag based on the version in manifest.json
- 🚀 Push the tag to GitHub
- 🎉 Create a GitHub release with the zip file attached

#### Prerequisites for Releases

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed: `brew install gh`
- GitHub CLI authenticated: `gh auth login`
- Write access to the repository
- Clean working directory (all changes committed)

#### Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- `v1.0.0` - Major release (breaking changes)
- `v1.1.0` - Minor release (new features, backwards compatible)
- `v1.0.1` - Patch release (bug fixes)

#### Troubleshooting Releases

**Tag already exists:**
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push --delete origin v1.0.0
make release
```

**Update an existing release:**
```bash
make build
gh release upload v1.0.0 date-range-reporter.zip --clobber
```
